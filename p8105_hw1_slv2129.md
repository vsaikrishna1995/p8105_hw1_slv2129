# Problem 1

Installing tidyverse library to call the tibble function

Creating a data frame consisting of the following: \* a random sample of
size 10 from a standard Normal distribution \* a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 \* a
character vector of length 10 \* a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    rand_samp log_vec char_vec fac_vec
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>    <fct>  
    ##  1     0.869 TRUE    the      good   
    ##  2     0.318 TRUE    and      bad    
    ##  3     1.49  TRUE    in       average
    ##  4    -0.137 FALSE   tree     good   
    ##  5     1.04  TRUE    wood     bad    
    ##  6    -1.50  FALSE   bird     average
    ##  7    -0.145 FALSE   fish     good   
    ##  8     0.353 TRUE    food     bad    
    ##  9     0.112 TRUE    rock     average
    ## 10    -1.13  FALSE   stone    good

Taking mean of each variable in nd\_df

``` r
mean(nd_df$rand_samp)
```

    ## [1] 0.1275618

``` r
mean(nd_df$log_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(nd_df$char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(nd_df$char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(nd_df$fac_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(nd_df$fac_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

From the above we can deduce one can find the mean for numeric and
logical vectors. Whereas, the mean can’t be calculated for character and
factor data type vectors.

Converting the logical, character, and factor data type variables to
numeric

Both factor and logical variables got number coded. The “good”, “bad”
and “average” have been replaced with 3,2 and 1 respectively for the
factor variable. In the case of logical vector, “true” (condition
satisfied) has been coded as 1 and “false” has been coded as 0. All the
components of character variable have been replaced with “NA”. This
explains why the mean function can only be applied to numeric and
logical variable. However, the factor variable can’t perform numeric
operations despite the numerical representation.

The following actions will be performed in the chuck of code below: \*
convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by
the result \* convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the
random sample by the result \* convert the logical vector to a factor
and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample
by the result

# Problem 2

Loading the penguins dataset and ggplot2 library:

The penguins dataset consists of the following variables: species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The penguin species associated with this
respective dataset are Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. Among these species,
the gender distribution is as follows: 165, 168, 11. This data has been
recorded on the penguin species from the Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen
islands. This dataset comprises of 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean
flipper length of the penguins is observed as NA.
