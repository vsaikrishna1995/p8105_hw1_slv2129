# Problem 1

Installing tidyverse library to call the tibble function

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Creating a data frame consisting of the following: \* a random sample of
size 10 from a standard Normal distribution \* a logical vector
indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0 \* a
character vector of length 10 \* a factor vector of length 10, with 3
different factor “levels”

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    rand_samp log_vec char_vec fac_vec
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>    <fct>  
    ##  1     0.487 TRUE    the      good   
    ##  2     1.47  TRUE    and      bad    
    ##  3     0.699 TRUE    in       average
    ##  4     0.154 TRUE    tree     good   
    ##  5    -1.26  FALSE   wood     bad    
    ##  6     0.485 TRUE    bird     average
    ##  7     1.23  TRUE    fish     good   
    ##  8     0.630 TRUE    food     bad    
    ##  9     1.55  TRUE    rock     average
    ## 10    -0.650 FALSE   stone    good

Mean of random sample variable:

    ## [1] 0.4794416

Mean of logical vector:

    ## [1] 0.8

Mean of character vector:

    ## Warning in mean.default(nd_df$char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Mean of factor vector:

    ## Warning in mean.default(nd_df$fac_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

From above we can deduce that one can find the mean for numeric and
logical vectors. Whereas, the mean can’t be calculated for character and
factor data type vectors.

Converting the logical, character, and factor data type variables to
numeric

``` r
log_num = as.numeric(nd_df$log_vec)

char_num = as.numeric(nd_df$char_vec)

fac_num = as.numeric(nd_df$fac_vec)
```

Both factor and logical variables got number coded. The “good”, “bad”
and “average” have been replaced with 3,2 and 1 respectively for the
factor variable. In the case of logical vector, “true” (condition
satisfied) has been coded as 1 and “false” has been coded as 0. All the
components of character variable have been replaced with “NA”. This
explains why the mean function can only be applied to numeric and
logical variable. However, the factor variable can’t perform numeric
operations despite the numerical representation.

The following actions will be performed in the chuck of code below: \*
convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by
the result \* convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the
random sample by the result \* convert the logical vector to a factor
and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample
by the result

    ##  [8] 0.6302372 1.5519636 0.0000000

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

    ##  [1]  0.9746473  2.9354453  1.3985372  0.3085278 -1.2591688  0.9693346
    ##  [7]  2.4553963  1.2604743  3.1039273 -0.6495603

# Problem 2

Loading the penguins dataset and ggplot2 library:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
library(ggplot2)
```

The penguins dataset consists of the following variables: species,
island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
body\_mass\_g, sex, year. The penguin species associated with this
respective dataset are Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. Among these species,
the gender distribution is as follows: (female, male, other) 165, 168,
11. This data has been recorded on the penguin species from the Biscoe,
Dream, Torgersen islands. This dataset comprises of 344 rows and 8
columns. The mean flipper length of the penguins is observed as
200.9152047.
